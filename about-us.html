              <h4>Secretary-General</h4>
              <p>Kyla Duggal is a senior at McLean High School and is incredibly excited to be serving as the Secretary-General of McMUNC VI! This is Kyla’s fourth and last year planning and hosting McMUNC, and she cannot wait! Having participated in Model UN since 7th grade, global affairs has become one of her passions. Outside of MUN, you can find her rowing on the Potomac, volunteering at her public library, and learning Latin and Hindi. In her free time, she enjoys traveling and stress baking up a storm. Kyla hopes that all delegates come to McMUNC with the mindset to grow themselves as delegates and not just their award collections. Model UN has brought her long-lasting friendships and skills, and she hopes that all delegates will receive the same rewarding experiences. Kyla can’t wait to meet everyone at McMUNC VI this fall!</p>

                <h4>Director-General</h4>
                <p>Samir Chowdhury is currently in his senior year at McLean High School and is beyond thrilled to be serving as the Director-General for McMUNC VI. Having spent a lot of time in high school conducting scientific research on environmental issues, Samir enjoys debate and policy-making in Model UN as another avenue to express his fervor for creating environmental solutions. When he’s not at conferences proposing the implementation of bacteria or seaweeds to solve climate change (real ones get this), you can find Samir cycling through one of the DMV’s many trails, binging shows on Netflix while trying to do his homework, or drafting articles to publish on Lenses. With McMUNC VI being Samir’s last one as a student, he really wants to emphasize MUN’s core tenants of eloquence, research, and diplomacy and hopes that delegates come ready for an intense debate with innovative solutions. Having served as the Director of Technology for McMUNC V, Samir is eager to bring McMUNC VI to fruition this autumn!</p>

              <p>Leah Siegel is currently a junior attending McLean High School and is honored to be the Chief of Staff for McMUNC VI. She began Model UN in the 7th grade and has formed many incredible friendships and developed real world skills through the club. She hopes that delegates focus on developing their skills and discussing important issues rather than the awards. Outside of Model UN, Leah watches soccer, does martial arts, plays the french horn in the McLean Symphonic Band, and stresses over her grades. Leah hopes that you all have an amazing time at McMUNC VI and cannot wait to see you in committee!</p>

              <h4>Director of Crisis</h4>
              <p>Peter Awabdeh is currently a senior at McLean High School and is ecstatic to serve as your Director of Crisis for McMUNC VI! Peter started Model UN in the 7th grade having fallen in love with the club and the community it provides. Outside of Model UN, Peter enjoys playing the violin for the MHS Orchestra, being a part of YES North America, planning KILMUNC, and hanging out with his friends. After doing quite a few crisis committees, Peter hopes to appropriately assess and incorporate creative arcs to the central flow of committee in order to truly reward the hard work delegates put into their private arcs, while still appreciating the sharing and contribution of delegates to the creation of public directives. He largely believes passion is the key to succeeding in committee as your passion drives your speaking, work ethic and collaboration with others. Peter is thrilled to make McMUNC VI’s crisis committees the most enjoyable, yet most rewarding for every delegate.</p>

                <p>Zayan Baig is currently a senior at McLean High School and is thrilled to serve as your Director of Technology for McMUNC VI. He began actively participating in Model UN in his sophomore year and has thoroughly enjoyed the cherishable debates, friendships, and memories it has fostered for him ever since. Though he is the one in charge of distributing many delegate awards, he would like to reiterate the importance of Model UN beyond receiving pieces of paper and wood: to learn about world issues while having fun! Outside of Model UN, Zayan plays the trumpet as Section Leader for the Highlander Marching Band, Symphonic Band, Jazz Ensemble, and various Brass Ensembles. In his free time, he can be found pampering his rabbit named Oreo, binging on the latest seasons of La Casa de Papel (Money Heist), or at BJ’s eating pizookies. Zayan hopes you are as excited as he is for this conference and looks forward to seeing you all at McMUNC VI!</p>

                  <h2>Andrew Zhao</h2>
                  <h4>Vice Director of Technology</h4>
                  <p>Being very familiar with McMUNC’s operations, Andrew Zhao, a Junior at McLean High School, is extremely excited acting as McMUNC VI’s Vice Director of Technology. This being his third year serving with McMUNC’s Technology Directors, Andrew has been working hard to ensure that this year’s McMUNC will be like none other. Due to the unfortunate consequences that COVID-19 has had on McMUNC VI, Andrew hopes to capitalize on his plethora of experience with technology and his time with MUN to make this year’s McMUNC the best it can be. Standing from a technological point-of-view, Andrew is hoping to improve, if not maintain, the same excellent delegate experience as seen in past conferences this year, no matter the challenge. Throughout this conference, Andrew hopes that it can remind you, as it has reminded him, that no matter how far apart we are, Model United Nations stands together as one community. Andrew looks forward to virtually meeting everyone this year!</p>
